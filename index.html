            Yes! Every feature of Listify is free, and we are committed to
            keeping it that way. Our goal is to offer a tool that everyone can
            use without any cost. All future features that we add will also be
            free, and Listify will never ask you to pay.

            Do I need to download an app, or can I use it in my browser?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Listify is a web-based tool, so you can use it directly in your
            browser without needing to download anything. While there is no
            mobile app currently available, one may be introduced in the future.
            We are working every day to make Listify more accessible and broaden
            its reach.

            efficiently. You can add team members to different projects, so
